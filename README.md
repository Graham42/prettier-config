# Prettier Config

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is an awesome tool, however I have a preference
for some config that differs from the defaults. My reasoning is fully explained
in the [config file](./index.js).

# Setup

Run this command to install and configure prettier:

```sh
npx @graham42/prettier-config
```

or if you are writing `es5` code run:

```sh
npx @graham42/prettier-config es5
```
