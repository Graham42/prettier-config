# :art: Automated project setup - [Prettier][]

This package provides automated setup of [Prettier][] in a new project.

It will set up scripts `check:format` and `fix:format` in package.json, a
minimal config file at `.prettierrc.js` for better git diffs, and some other
helpful config files such as VS Code project settings.
